// Deliberately excluded from this sitemap (checked against every page.tsx
// under src/app as of 2026-10-01, not just the routes someone remembered to
// list here):
//   - Admin/merchant/fundraiser dashboards and their login/token flows —
//     already behind auth or a one-time token; robots.txt disallows them.
//   - Per-organization dynamic pages (/g, /c, /campaign, /embed, /f, /t) —
//     tenant content, not WGC marketing content; each org's own giving/
//     campaign page can be indexed on its own merits, not bulk-listed here.
//   - Token-gated private flows (/invoice, /setup, /activate-subscription,
//     /onboarding/update) — no SEO value and shouldn't be indexed at all.
//   - /first-look(/confirmed), /walkthrough, /churches — a live sales-call
//     funnel, a thin iframe wrapper, and a page superseded by a permanent
//     redirect to /for/churches (next.config.ts) respectively. None are the
//     canonical version of anything worth ranking.
