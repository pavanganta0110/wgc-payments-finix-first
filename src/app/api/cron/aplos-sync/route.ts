/**
 * Own schedule, separate from the existing /api/cron/reconcile (per
 * docs/integrations/aplos.md section 1 — this is a distinct concern from
 * Finix settlement/webhook reconciliation). Not yet added to vercel.json's
 * crons array — that's an infrastructure change deliberately deferred until
 * a pilot organization is ready to enable automatic sync, so this never
 * starts running against real (even sandbox) data before that's intended.
 *
 * For each Church with AplosConnection.automaticSyncEnabled = true and
 * status CONNECTED, finds every SETTLED FinixSettlement that settled on or
 * after this connection was made — never a settlement that predates the
 * connection, so enabling automatic sync can never silently back-post a
 * church's entire prior settlement history into their Aplos ledger as
 * duplicate contributions they may have already entered by hand. A church
 * that genuinely wants historical settlements synced can request that
 * explicitly (a future, deliberate action, not an automatic side effect of
 * enabling sync) — and does not already have a SYNCED/NEEDS_REVIEW/
 * CANCELLED AplosSyncRecord at the connection's current syncVersion. Each
 * candidate is handed to AplosSettlementSyncService.processSettlement,
 * which itself performs the real eligibility, locking, and retry-due
 * checks per settlement.
