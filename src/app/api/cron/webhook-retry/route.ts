/**
 * Runs once daily (see vercel.json) — retries any webhook delivery whose
 * nextRetryAt has passed. Daily, not every 15 minutes as originally
 * designed: this project's Vercel plan only allows once-per-day cron
 * schedules (a more frequent expression fails at deploy time), so a
 * failed delivery's automated retry can now be delayed up to ~24h behind
 * its computed backoff time. This does NOT affect the primary delivery
 * path — emitEvent() still attempts every delivery immediately and inline
 * regardless of this cron's cadence; this cron is purely the backstop for
 * deliveries that failed and are waiting on backoff, or for a delivery
 * whose inline attempt never got the chance to run (e.g. the process was
 * recycled). Upgrading the Vercel plan would let this run far more often.
 * Same CRON_SECRET bearer-auth pattern as every other cron in this app.
