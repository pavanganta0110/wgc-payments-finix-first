/**
 * Exception-path activation only — not a routine approval step. The normal
 * path (SUBMITTED -> PENDING_VERIFICATION -> UNDER_REVIEW -> APPROVED) is
 * fully automated via webhooks/reconciliation. This route exists because
 * there is no confirmed Finix API in this codebase to detect or trigger
 * "this instrument is now the active payout destination," so once an
 * account is APPROVED, WGC support confirms activation once out of band
 * (via the auto-created exception ticket) and calls this to finalize it.
 * An organization can go through this flow any number of times — every
 * previously active account is preserved as HISTORICAL, never deleted.
 *
 * Delegates the actual state transition to activatePayoutDestination(),
 * shared with the future automatic path so switching an already-verified
 * account still requires it to have gone through full review (status must
 * be APPROVED) — reactivating a HISTORICAL account is never a shortcut.
