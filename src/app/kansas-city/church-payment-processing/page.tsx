              <h2>Stewardship for Local KC Ministries</h2>
              <p>
                Kansas City is home to a vibrant, growing community of ministries, churches, and nonprofits. However, many of these local organizations in KCMO and the surrounding metro area are losing thousands of dollars annually to high, hidden percentage fees charged by generic payment processors. We built WGC to solve this. Our mission is to provide <strong>transparent church payment processing in Kansas City</strong> that empowers your ministry to fund the mission, not the bank.
              </p>
              <p>
                By shifting to a <Link href="/pricing">stewardship-first pricing model</Link>, KC churches can take advantage of our flat-rate ACH at just 25¢ per transaction. When your congregation gives a $1,000 tithe via bank transfer, you pay exactly 25¢—not $10 or $30 like other platforms charge.
              </p>

              <h2>Built for Kansas City Software Partners</h2>
              <p>
                We don't just serve churches directly; we are the silent engine behind the software platforms they use. If you are a Kansas City software company building tools for ministries, our white-label API allows you to embed a fully compliant donation page natively within your app. You can review our <Link href="/developers">protocol specs and developer documentation</Link> to see how seamlessly we integrate into your existing stack.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Experience the Difference</h2>
              <p>
                Transitioning your church's payment processing shouldn't be a headache. We provide dedicated onboarding and a frictionless experience for your donors. Take a look at our <Link href="/start">interactive donation page demo</Link> to see the exact flow your KC congregation will experience when giving.
