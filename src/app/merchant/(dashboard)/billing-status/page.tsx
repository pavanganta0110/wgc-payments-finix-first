/**
 * The tailored destination for every restricted dashboard access state —
 * reached via the (dashboard)/error.tsx boundary's link, or directly. Unlike
 * error.tsx (a client component that only ever receives a serialized Error
 * with no state info, see its own comment for why), this is a server
 * component that calls requireMerchantSession(true) itself and reads the
 * real orgAccessState directly — so it can show the accurate reason without
 * ever needing to serialize billing state through a thrown error.
 *
 * Deliberately shows only enough to explain WHY access is restricted and
 * what to do next — never payment method, charge history, promotion
 * details, or cancellation controls (those stay behind the full gate on
 * /merchant/subscription, reachable from here for the actions that remain
 * available in each state).
