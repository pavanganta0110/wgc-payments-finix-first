                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-wgc-navy-950 mb-3">Is WGC just a payment processor?</h3>
                  <p className="text-wgc-navy-500 leading-relaxed font-medium">No. WGC is a complete giving and payment management platform for mission-driven organizations — nonprofits, churches and ministries, foundations, associations, schools, and community organizations. Beyond accepting card, ACH, and digital wallet payments, WGC includes supporter management, recurring giving, giving and campaign pages, invoicing, reporting and analytics with CSV exports, settlements and payouts, refunds, year-end statements, team accounts with role-based permissions (Owner, Admin, Fundraiser, Viewer), and accounting integrations — all in one dashboard, instead of piecing together separate tools. WGC also provides payment infrastructure for software platforms that serve these organizations.</p>

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-wgc-navy-950 mb-3">How much does WGC cost for a nonprofit, church, or other organization?</h3>
                  <p className="text-wgc-navy-500 leading-relaxed font-medium">When a supporter chooses to cover the processing fee, the cost to the organization is $0. Organizations that choose to absorb the fee pay a maximum of 2.3% + 25¢ per card transaction and a flat 25¢ per ACH transaction. Every organization also pays a simple $10/month WGC platform fee, which includes full access to the dashboard and every platform feature — not just payment processing.</p>

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-wgc-navy-950 mb-3">Does WGC support team accounts and staff permissions?</h3>
                  <p className="text-wgc-navy-500 leading-relaxed font-medium">Yes. WGC supports Owner, Admin, Fundraiser, and Viewer roles so any organization can give each staff member or volunteer their own login with access scoped to what they actually need, instead of sharing one account and password.</p>

                  <p className="text-wgc-navy-500 leading-relaxed font-medium">WGC is built for nonprofits, churches, foundations, associations, schools, and other mission-driven organizations that want more than a giving page — it combines supporter management, recurring giving, campaigns, invoicing, reporting, settlements, refunds, year-end statements, team accounts with role-based permissions, and accounting integrations in one platform, with a $0 processing cost option when supporters cover the fee.</p>
