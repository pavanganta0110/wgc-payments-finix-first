/**
 * The full catalog of event types WGC emits. This is the single source of
 * truth consumed by: outbound webhook delivery, the merchant dashboard's
 * webhook-subscription picker, and (later) Zapier/Make triggers — adding a
 * new event type here does not require a migration (WebhookEvent.type and
 * WebhookEndpoint.subscribedEventsJson are plain strings/JSON, not a
 * Prisma enum), only wiring an emitEvent() call at the new event's source.
 *
 * Every event type listed here is either already emitted by application
 * code (see the file:line references) or explicitly not yet wired — check
 * src/lib/events/emitEvent.ts call sites before assuming one fires today.
