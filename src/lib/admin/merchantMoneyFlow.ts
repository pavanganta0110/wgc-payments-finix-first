/**
 * Per-organization money flow for the WGC admin dashboard: what each
 * organization collected, what it was charged in fees, and what Finix has
 * actually sent to its bank account. Read-only.
 *
 * Every figure is summed in Postgres from Finix's own records:
 *   collected  — successful charges (FinixTransfer, same rule as the
 *                dashboard's Total processed), attributed organizations only
 *   refunded   — successful refunds/reversals + ACH returns (FinixRefundOrReversal, BankReturn)
 *   fees       — PLATFORM_FEE rows (FinixFee); donor-covered supplemental
 *                fees are a subset of this, shown separately
 *   deposited  — payouts Finix pushed TO the organization's bank (SUCCEEDED
 *                funding transfers of type CREDIT)
 *   pulled back — small fee settlements Finix pulls FROM the organization's
 *                bank (SUCCEEDED funding transfers of type DEBIT, "pull from
 *                ACH"). They are money leaving the bank, never a deposit.
 *
 * "Awaiting deposit" = collected − refunded − fees − (deposited − pulled back). It is a
 * reconciliation line, not an error: settlements land on a delay and fee
 * rows aren't final until about the 15th of the next month, so a non-zero
 * value usually just means money that is still in flight. A negative value
 * (deposited more than expected) is flagged for a look.
