 * Team-access Checkpoint 4A correction (revisited): dispute reads are now
 * scoped through their related payment's attribution field — see
 * resolveScopedTransferIds in insightsData.ts, used by the disputes list/
 * detail pages and the evidence-download route to filter to only disputes
 * whose originating payment is attributed to the requester. With that
 * scoping in place, FUNDRAISER/VIEWER can see their own disputes
 * (canViewOwnTransactions) instead of being denied entirely; OWNER/ADMIN
 * keep unscoped organization-wide access (canManageOrgSettings). Upload/
 * delete/submit remain owner/admin-only — responding to a dispute is a
 * financial action, not a visibility question.
