/**
 * Runs when an OnboardingApplication is approved. Creates (or updates) the
 * Church row — which nothing else in the codebase populates today — and
 * provisions a church_admin User account with a set-password link, then
 * sends the "secure dashboard access email" referenced in the approval
 * email copy. Idempotent: safe to call again on webhook retries — but
 * "safe" means "won't re-invite someone who already finished setup," not
 * "won't retry a failed send." A User row existing is not proof the email
 * ever arrived, so re-invoking this only skips the email once the user has
 * actually set a password or logged in.
